A few months ago, I was explaining that I was wanting to start uploading files
again. I was looking to start soon, but that soon became a few weeks and a few
weeks became a few months as caution and trepidation meant that I was hesitant
to pull the trigger and start uploading.

The trouble I found myself in is that I wanted two things at the same time: both
that the music to sound good as well as start getting things out there. There
are the two forces competing in this process. The end goal of all of this is for
the robots to be creating music that people will want to stay and listen to. But
to get there, I need to start getting the music out there so I can actually
evaluate what they produce, and not look at it from a data standpoint.

So at the beginning of July I finally pulled the trigger and started to publish
music again. While the first batch was generated before July, the summer was
full of activities that put me in a position where I didn't want to publish
while being away. And more than that, I as just plain hesitant to, trapped in
the question of what the best path forward actually was. For the first week, I
set the robots to publish every day.  After the first week, I decided to reset
it so that there is a new published video every other day, and for the time
being, I think that's what I am going to leave it as.

In the immediate future, I need to sit again to listen and take notes, then I
have basically two paths for improvements. The first path is to fix the
melody extraction process, while the second is to make the music created by the
robots better with the existing melodies and process as they are now. While it
would exceedingly satisfying and interesting to work on improving the melodies,
the melodies I have now are not completely broken. In the cases I've heard so
far, the melodies themselves are at times nonsensical or don't have great
rhythm, but overall they are, I believe at this point, workable.

But the biggest reasons to work on making the robots sound better with the
melodies I have now is the scope of work. There is a lot of work to be done to
fix the melodies, and a lot of moving parts that have to be kept in my head at
once. Fixing what they sound like with what is there has more but smaller
components I can work on in sequence. Each of these components individually
hopefully will make the whole thing more entertaining. Not that I won't tackle
the melodies, I'm sure I will, but this is the better elephant to eat first. And
how do you eat an elephant?  One bite at a time, although, I would assume it'd
go rotten before you can finish the elephant.
